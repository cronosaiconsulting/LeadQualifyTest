## 📝 NOTES FROM TODAY (Day 1)

### What Went Well:
- MessageComposer implemented smoothly with clean architecture
- Spanish NLP service using Python/spaCy works as expected
- Metric self-documentation pattern is elegant and extensible
- Setup script provides good developer experience

### Challenges:
- None major - all implementations went smoothly
- TypeScript/Python integration straightforward with stdin/stdout

### Decisions Made:
- Template-first message composition (vs full LLM generation)
- Python subprocess for spaCy (vs attempting TypeScript NLP)
- Self-documenting base class pattern for metrics

### Tomorrow's Focus:
- Complete all 44 self-documenting metrics
- Write and run tests for Phase 0 and 1.1
- Begin cultural adaptation implementation
