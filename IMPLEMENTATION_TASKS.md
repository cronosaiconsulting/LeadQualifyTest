# Implementation Tasks & Subtasks
## Lead Qualification AI System Completion

**Project:** Lead Qualification AI for B2B WhatsApp Conversations
**Objective:** Complete all missing requirements for production-ready deployment
**Priority:** LIFE-SAVING (Maximum priority as per instructions)

---

---

## 🎯 IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

**Alignment Philosophy:** This task list now follows the "Cognitive Stack" architecture from the original instructions (KNOWLEDGE section, items 1-9), prioritizing:

1. **GraphRAG-First:** Microsoft GraphRAG pipeline as the foundation
2. **Evidence & Attribution:** Traceable data lineage for every decision
3. **Agentic Reasoning:** ReAct + Reflexion for complex tasks
4. **Tiered Memory:** MemGPT-style working/episodic/semantic memory
5. **Continuous Measurement:** Ragas + Phoenix/Langfuse evaluation stack

**Critical Change from Previous Approach:**
- Previous focus: Graphiti + LangGraph as primary frameworks
- **NEW focus:** Microsoft GraphRAG + Evidence Graphs + full Cognitive Stack implementation
- Graphiti can be integrated later as an enhancement, but GraphRAG pipeline is core requirement

## 🎯 CRITICAL CHANGES FROM ORIGINAL TASK LIST

### What Changed and Why:

**1. NEW FOUNDATION: GraphRAG-Based Architecture**
- **Original:** Focused on Graphiti + basic frameworks
- **NEW:** Microsoft/Neo4j GraphRAG pipeline as core requirement
- **Why:** Instructions explicitly require GraphRAG with community summaries and hierarchical retrieval

**2. ADDED: Evidence Graph Architecture**
- **Why:** North-star goal #1 is "Factual & Attributable" - requires citation and provenance tracking
- **Impact:** Every answer now traceable to source evidence

**3. ADDED: MemGPT-Style Tiered Memory**
- **Why:** Instructions require "bounded but long-lived memory with paging beyond context window"
- **Impact:** Can maintain coherence in 50+ message conversations

**4. ADDED: ReAct + Reflexion Orchestration**
- **Why:** Instructions require "reason + act" with self-correction
- **Impact:** True agentic behavior, not just question selection

**5. ADDED: Ragas + Phoenix/Langfuse Evaluation**
- **Why:** North-star goal #5 is "continuously measurable"
- **Impact:** Can objectively measure and improve system

**6. ADDED: NeMo Guardrails + Guardrails AI**
- **Why:** Instructions Section 2G requires programmable rails and structured outputs
- **Impact:** Safety, policy enforcement, hallucination prevention

**7. ADDED: Hybrid Search Architecture**
- **Why:** Instructions require "dense + sparse (BM25/RRF) for robust recall"
- **Impact:** 35%+ better retrieval accuracy

**8. ADDED: Ingestion Pipeline**
- **Why:** Instructions Section 2A requires multi-format parsing with provenance
- **Impact:** Can ingest company docs, not just WhatsApp messages

**9. ADDED: Multi-Objective Utility Function**
- **Why:** Instructions Section 3 requires explicit decision policy
- **Impact:** Systematic optimization with explainable trade-offs

**10. ENHANCED: Situational Graph**
- **Why:** Instructions require temporal + session + environment + tool modeling
- **Impact:** Complete "world model" for context-aware behavior

   - ReAct + Reflexion integration
   - Evidence graph construction

3. **Daily Integration Testing:**
   - Test end-to-end flow daily
   - Use Ragas metrics to validate quality
   - Run A/B tests via Thompson Sampling
   - Monitor with Phoenix/Langfuse

4. **Document as You Build:**
   - Update /doc folder concurrently
   - Create architecture diagrams
   - Write API specifications
   - Record design decisions

5. **Leverage Pre-Built Components:**
   - Use Microsoft GraphRAG or Neo4j GraphRAG package
   - Use LangGraph templates for ReAct
   - Use Ragas evaluation presets
   - Use NeMo Guardrails examples

## 🎓 KEY LEARNING FROM INSTRUCTIONS

**The fundamental insight:** This is not a "lead qualification chatbot with metrics." This is a **production-quality GraphRAG-based conversational AI system** that happens to be applied to lead qualification.

**The architecture must follow:**
- Graph-augmented RAG for retrieval
- Evidence-based attribution for trust
- Agentic reasoning for complex tasks
- Tiered memory for long contexts
- Continuous evaluation for optimization
- Programmable safety for reliability

**This is the difference between:**
- ❌ Basic chatbot: LLM + prompts + basic state
- ✅ Cognitive stack: Perception → Memory → Reasoning → Action → Evaluation

This revised task list ensures the implementation matches the **production-quality, first-principles architecture** specified in the original instructions.
