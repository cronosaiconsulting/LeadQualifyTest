## Quick Start

1. Read `/architecture/README.md` for system overview
2. Follow `/deployment/setup-guide.md` for installation
3. Review `/api/REST-endpoints.md` for API usage

## Key Concepts

### Multi-Dimensional Situation Awareness
The system tracks 7 dimensions of conversation state:
1. Engagement
2. Qualification
3. Technical
4. Emotional
5. Cultural
6. Conversation Health (meta)
7. System Confidence (meta)

### Message Humanization
All questions are transformed into natural B2B conversations with:
- Time-appropriate greetings
- User response acknowledgments
- Smooth topic transitions
- Cultural and regional adaptation

### Spanish NLP Integration
spaCy-based entity extraction and analysis:
- Named Entity Recognition (companies, people, money, dates)
- Sentiment analysis
- Formality detection (tÃº/usted)
- Business signal detection (budget, authority, urgency)

### Thompson Sampling
Exploration/exploitation balance for optimal question selection with decreasing learning rate over time.
